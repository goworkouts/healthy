The vascular bundle is composed of xylem, phloem, and sometimes a layer of cambium cells. Some vascular bundles are described as open since they contain dividing. The transport itself happens in vascular tissue, which exists in two forms: These vascular tissues are located very close to each other in the plant and form a bundle known as vascular bundle.

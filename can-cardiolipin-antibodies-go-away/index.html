<p>When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. Cardiolipin antibodies are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the body’s own cardiolipins, substances found in the outermost layer of cells (cell membranes) and platelets. A negative result means only that cardiolipin antibodies are not present or not present at a detectable level in the blood at the time of the test.

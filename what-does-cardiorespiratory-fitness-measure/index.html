<p>Your doctor can measure cardiorespiratory fitness through what's called your maximal oxygen consumption (vo2 max) or from readings taken while you do an aerobic workout. The capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to provide oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy synthesis during physical activity is referred to as cardiorespiratory fitness (crf). Good crf is not only important for your overall health and quality of life, such as your energy levels, sleep, and mood, but it also reduces the risk of heart disease.

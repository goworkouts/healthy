Monocots have a closed type of vascular bundle, i.e. It consists of complex tissues of the xylem and phloem. The vascular bundle is composed of xylem, phloem, and sometimes a layer of cambium cells. 1 n a unit strand of the vascular system in stems and leaves of higher plants consisting essentially of xylem and phloem synonyms:

<p>Water and ions are transported mainly by xylem, and dissolved organic solutes mainly by the phloem. Main vascular bundles form a single conspicuous abaxial arc, alternating with air canals, and embedded in chlorenchyma.

<p>What does vascular bundle mean? The vascular bundles are arranged in three layers, developing unequally at different levels. Open vascular bundles are the vascular bundles which comprises of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem. The main function of blood vessels is transporting blood from the heart to the rest of the tissues and organs throughout the body and then bringing it back to the heart. Closed vascular bundles lack.</p>

<h3 id="blood-vessels-include-three-main-types">Blood Vessels Include Three Main Types:</h3><p>In open vascular bundles a layer of cambium will be present between the xylem and phloem and thus they shows secondary growth. Cambium is a meristematic tissue responsible for secondary growth in plants. It is a strand of the particular vascular tissue of higher plants consisting mostly of xylem and phloem.

<h3 id="those-in-which-the-two-types-of-tissues-are-separated-from-one-another">Those In Which The Two Types Of Tissues Are Separated From One Another.</h3><p>Open vascular bundles are the vascular bundles which comprises of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem. Vascular bundles are classified based on different criterion a) depending upon the presence or absence of cambrium they may be open or closed. A vascular bundle is a part of the transport system in vascular plants which is comprise two tissues. The main function of blood vessels is transporting blood from the heart to the rest of the tissues and organs throughout the body and then bringing it back to the heart.</p>

The vascular bundles develop from the procambium of the growing stem. Xylem transports water for the plant, while phloem transports food. Both the tissues conduct substances.</p>

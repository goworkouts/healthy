<p>Many of the effects of cardiolipin are due to its unique structure. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them for just a short while due to an infection or drug, or present but without symptoms as a person ages. The structure of cardiolipin is also able to change, allowing it to adapt into different shapes.

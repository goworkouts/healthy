<p>The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases. They help to regulate the way the blood is able to clot when an injury occurs, though the process of it is not completely. Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies persisting when tested 12 weeks later, indicates continued presence of the antibody. It interacts with multiple proteins, enzymes and metabolite carriers, taking part in a number of reactions and helping in the optimal.</p>

<p>When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. An iga phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibody result above 15 apl with negative igg and igm phospholipids (cardiolipin) antibody results is not diagnostic for aps. The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m). An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight off infection.

<p>Both higher coronary artery calcification (cac) scores and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) are independently strong predictors of future cardiovascular events. Always do 5 minutes of stretching or moving around to warm up your muscles and heart before exercising. In addition, regular exercise reduces myocardial oxygen demand and increases exercise capacity, translating into reduced coronary risk. Sustained physical activity is most helpful in the prevention of weight regain.</p>

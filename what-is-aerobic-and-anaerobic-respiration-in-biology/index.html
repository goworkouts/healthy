<p>The main difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is that anaerobic respiration doesn’t require oxygen to be present. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy. So, they begin to respire anaerobically in order to. Aerobic respiration respiration using oxygen to break down food molecules is called aerobic respiration.</p>

<p>Any work is propelled by a form of energy. Glucose and oxygen are the reactants and. This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. This is the process of taking one glucose (sugar) molecule and breaking it down into pyruvate and energy (2 atp). Difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration Bio Differences.</p>

THE ALL CARB DIET (Burn Fat w/ Carbs) Gravity Transformation From gravitytransformation.com
My basic understanding was that the body will first utilize glucose and glycogen stores, followed by fats and finally proteins once the fat and glycogen stores become depleted. When mild exercise is performed there is a tendency to burn relatively more fat and less glucose. The amount of carbohydrates you consume has an effect on your body’s ability to burn fat. Depending on the intensity, the proportion of fat your body is burning as an energy source can change from around 30 percent to 60 percent.

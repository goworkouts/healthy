List 3 differences between aerobic and anaerobic exercise From brainly.com
Regardless of your goal distance—whether you’re gearing up for an ultra or just want to crank out a couple miles at a time—you need both. While aerobic metabolism generates more atp and relies on oxygen, anaerobic metabolism does not need oxygen but only creates. In order to have an understanding of which category marathon running falls into, you first need to know what aerobic and anaerobic actually mean. For anaerobic activity, think the 100m sprint.

<p>By now, you probably get the idea of how aerobic running differs from anaerobic running: How the body uses stored energy. The anaerobic system delivers energy significantly faster, and will therefore deliver a greater part of the energy when the intensity is higher. Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you’re training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy.</p>

Cardio before or after weight lifting Which one is better for weight From cnet.com
If you’re trying to lose body fat, don’t shun strength training because cardio burns more calories. Therefore, if you want to lose weight, your best option is to engage in both cardio and strength training exercises. Once your cardio session is over, and you switch to weights, your energy levels are nearly depleted. If you do weights first, it will zap some of that away leading to a less productive cardio session.

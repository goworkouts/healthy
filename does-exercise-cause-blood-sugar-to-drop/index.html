How to check blood sugar levels Understanding Diabetes Mellitus From understandingdiabetesmellitus.com
Moderate to intense exercise may cause your blood sugar to drop during exercise and for the next 24 hours following exercise. The blood sugar level is more likely to drop during exercise in people who have stronger and bigger muscles because muscles are responsible for about 90% of the body’s use of glucose. Although blood sugars may be higher initially, studies have shown that intense exercise increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by the body’s cells. When you exercise the body uses two sources of fuel, sugar and free fatty acids (that is, fat) to generate energy.

Long and short term effects of exercise EFMURGI From efmurgi.wordpress.com
In addition to the obvious effects of resistance training on muscle mass and strength, resistance training may lead to decreased risk for osteoporosis, fractures, and falls in later life. If you weight train regularly doing. Many practitioners find that regular exercise helps balance their emotional and mental health too. Thus, the research literature is scrutinized with regard to studies assessing muscle hypertrophy in response to.

Cellular Respiration From exploringnature.org
In green plants, photosynthesis is. Organisms that do not depend on oxygen degrade foodstuffs in a process called fermentation. Glycolysis takes place in the cytosol, the citric acid cycle. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ).

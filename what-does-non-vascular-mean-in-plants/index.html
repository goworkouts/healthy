Non Vascular Plants Examples From animalia-life.club
Nonvascular plants belong to the division bryophyta, which includes mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. Bryophytes are also nonflowering plants, meaning that they reproduce. They are small in size and may possess simpler structures for the conduction of water and nutrients. The liverworts, mosses and hornworts (shaw et al., 2011 ).

Due to their lack of vasculature and dependence on swimming sperm, these organisms require habitats with ample water. Nonvascular plants are made up of mosses, liverworts, and hornworts—all of which belong to the subdivision of plants called bryophyta or bryophytes. Lab 5 Mosses &amp; Ferns.

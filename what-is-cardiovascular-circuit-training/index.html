There are a number of types of cardiovascular training which can help you meet your fitness goals. I use circuit training for injury rehabilitation programs, for sports conditioning of elite level athletes, for improving cardiovascular fitness, for increasing strength, and to help clients lose weight. Granted, i’m a strong believer in weight training in addition to cardio, so i encourage you to incorporate other workout routines/activities into your workout schedule.

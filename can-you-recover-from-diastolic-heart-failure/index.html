Diastolic dysfunction is linked to excessive weight, diabetes, age and limited physical activity or a sedentary lifestyle. Echocardiography is the most important tool for the diagnosis of diastolic heart dysfunction. The impact of the liver cancer stage 4 is very bad, and the condition gets worse with time.

Brain plasticity theory is the exploration of the changes that occur in the brain. Functional refers to the ability of the brain to actually transport function from an unhealthy area of the brain to a healthy one. Neural connections can be forged and refined or weakened and severed. Brain plasticity occurs as a result of memory formation, experiences, and learning situations.

<p>Structural plasticity is when the brainâs structure is physically altered due to learning experiences. So it goes without saying that this is one of the neurological properties with the greatest evolutionary meaning. While it is evident that the brain changes with age and even deteriorates to some degree, it is also important to remember that environment can have an impact on the brain.

<p>If someone were to suffer a stroke that would limit certain physical functions, the healthy parts of the mind can eventually take over and restore the lost abilities. The brain is easily one of the most important parts of our body. Neuroplasticity explains that not only do our brains keep changing, but we actually have conscious control over how the brain changes as we age and have new experiences. This theory is also referred to as neuroplasticity. What is neuroplasticity? How does it work for kids &amp; adults? Secrets.</p>

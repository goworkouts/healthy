The reason why the breathing rate increases is because as the heart demands a higher supply of oxygen, the lungs have to work faster. As a general rule, the faster your heart rate recovers back down to normal after exercise, the better shape you're in overall. Repeat steps 2 and 3 three times, for a total of 4 cycles.

<p>Even if youâre somebody that doesnât exercise, to begin with, any basic form of cardio can go a long way. Kaiser permanente explains that when your heart gets stronger, it pushes out more blood with every beat â which means it doesn't have to work as hard to circulate adequate oxygen and nutrients when you exercise. The resulting number is your maximum heart rate, which is the number of beats per minute. Another thing to look at is your heart rate recovery, or how quickly your heart rate falls when you stop exercising. Why Does Our Heart Rate Increase During Exercise?.</p>

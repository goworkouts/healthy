<p>Aerobic respiration is divided into three main stages: Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. Aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration. Kreb’s cycle (mitochondria) anaerobic respiration take place in our muscles during various physical exercise when oxygen gets used up faster in the muscle cells than can be supplied by the blood.</p>

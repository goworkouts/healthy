PPT Muscular Strength and Endurance PowerPoint Presentation ID2181702 From slideserve.com
A good practical example of muscular strength would be your 1 repetition maximum squat or bench press, whereas an example of muscular endurance might be a 20 rep squat or a plank hold for as long as you can hold it with correct technique. To get the health benefits of physical activity, not only do you need to do aerobic activities that make you breathe harder and your heart beat faster, but you also need to do strengthening. The health benefits of strength training extend far beyond weight management and aesthetics. Muscular endurance is how many times you can move that weight without getting exhausted (very tired).

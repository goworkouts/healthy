A person's maximal heart rate may be estimated by subtracting 220 beats per minute (bpm) from their age. For example, if you’re 45 years old, subtract 45 from 220 to get a maximum heart rate of 175. By using the first two fingers of one hand and locating the artery, a pulse rate can be easily determined. Heart rate training Part 1 Why Zones? HAMILTON SPORT.</p>

<p>The number that you arrive at is considered your peak heart rate while exercising. If your heart rate exceeds 185 beats per minute during exercise, it is dangerous for you. This is the average maximum number of times your heart should beat per minute during exercise. The american heart association, for example, says your target heart rate during moderate intensity activities should be about 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate, while during vigorous physical activity you should aim for roughly 70% to 85% of your max.

<p>When you exercise at the highest possible intensity, your heart will reach maximal heart rate (hrmax), the fastest rate it is capable of beating. For example, if you’re 45 years old, subtract 45 from 220 to get a maximum heart rate of 175. Heart rate and exercise intensity share a direct, linear relationship: Since most people are unaware of this, they often panic when their normal heart rate 10 minutes after exercise differs from readings taken 15 minutes after a workout.

Meet the powerlifting grandma who can deadlift more than you Men&#39;s Health From menshealth.co.uk
Yes, in many jobs, lifting 50 pounds is probably a real requirement. That said, you should never start at 100 pounds. So, if you are 100 pounds, lifting anything up to 100 pounds in a deadlift is normal and anything beyond that is heavy lifting. Try as i might, i could not lift a 40 pound bag of garden soil.

Your brain counters with an increase in heart rate, but if dehydration continues, heart rate will continually. We will use a digital heart rate monitor strapped on our chest while we perform different levels of exercise. We have demonstrated that the activation of metabolically sensitive receptors in skeletal muscles (muscle metaboreflex) increases cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in humans, an effect that can be masked by elevations in parasympathetic tone. There are different conditioning factors during rest such as genetics, sex, age, psychological state, physical shape.

<p>Physical activity has significant health benefits for hearts, bodies and minds. Use the stethoscopes and timers to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles. Heart rate (hr) is the number of heartbeats per minute (bpm) and an increase during physical activity is normal. Combined effect of resting heart rate and physical activity on.</p>

We will use a digital heart rate monitor strapped on our chest while we perform different levels of exercise. Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. In our experiment the test subject needed more oxygen while exercising.

Your cardiovascular endurance can be negatively affected by heart disease. Cardiovascular endurance, otherwise known as aerobic endurance, measures how well you can exercise for a prolonged period. This is the system that kicks in third after the phosphogen and the glycogen lactic acid system, and so the one that supplies energy to the human circulatory system and the muscles. How to improve cardiovascular endurance.

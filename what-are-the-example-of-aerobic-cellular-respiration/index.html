According to some theory anaerobic respiration and fermentation both generate atp in absence of oxygen molecule but are not synonyms meaning they are different from each. Aerobic respiration is one of the two types of cellular respiration defined as a metabolic process involving the conversion of chemical substances from food into energy through the use of oxygen. The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration. Aerobic respiration, as the name suggests, is the process of producing the energy required by cells using oxygen.

<p>Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. It is also worth mentioning that the word âaerobicâ also refers to activities that depend on aerobic. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is the aerobic catabolism of nutrients to carbon dioxide, water, and energy, and involves an electron transport system in which molecular oxygen is the final electron acceptor.</p>

<p>11 rows  cellular respiration: It is known as aerobic respiration or aerobic respiration to a series of metabolic reactions that take place within the cells of living beings, through which chemical energy is obtained from the breakdown of organic molecules (cellular respiration). It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp. Aerobic respiration means the use of air and in technical terms it is using oxygen.breathing by most living organisms which is followed by krebs cycle as part of atp generation by the cells is an example of aerobic respiration. aerobic respiration Liberal Dictionary.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy. Biochemically, aerobic cellular respiration is defined as the process of metabolizing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp) from a series of redox reactions involving glucose sugar. For instance, if glucose were oxidized, the result would be. An example of cellular respiration in plants is the use of photoautotrophic processes to obtain the glucose needed for cellular.

<h3 id="during-cellular-respiration-in-humans-carbon-dioxide-is-produced">During Cellular Respiration In Humans, Carbon Dioxide Is Produced.</h3><p>It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. (a) glycolysis (b) krebs cycle (c) electron transport chain. Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and procedures that occur in the cells of organisms to transform chemical energy from oxygen molecules or food into adenosine triphosphate and after that release waste products.</p>

It is a complex process of obtaining energy , which consumes glucose (c6h12o6) as fuel and. According to some theory anaerobic respiration and fermentation both generate atp in absence of oxygen molecule but are not synonyms meaning they are different from each. Biochemically, aerobic cellular respiration is defined as the process of metabolizing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp) from a series of redox reactions involving glucose sugar.</p>

This oxygen molecule is then used for cellular respiration and the produced byproduct then also released in the water. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. Aerobic cellular respiration is the series of reactions that, with the help of oxygen, make atp (cellular energy) by completely breaking down glucose into inorganic molecules of carbon dioxide and water.</p>

Each step involves the conversion of one or more chemical substances to utilize the chemical. While cellular respiration (aerobic) requires oxygen to create energy and leaves co2 as a byproduct, photosynthesis uses co2 to create energy and leaves oxygen as a byproduct. Cellular respiration is defined as the conversion of fuel into energy and nutrients within the mitochondria and cytosol of cells.</p>

This form of stress testing is usually performed with exercise protocols using either a treadmill or bicycle. As your body works harder during the test, it requires more oxygen, so the heart must pump more blood. A stress test, sometimes called a treadmill test or exercise test, helps a doctor find out how well your heart handles work. This article presents information on the current methods of testing to help primary care providers gain confidence in test selection, the testing process, and interpreting results.

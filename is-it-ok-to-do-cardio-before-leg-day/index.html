<meta name="description" content="Incredible Is It Ok To Do Cardio Before Leg Day With Best Trainer, It’s really up to you. Okay, so ive just got back into lifting after many years of not getting any significant exercise.
Cardio for Beginners at the Gym Healthy Living From healthyliving.azcentral.com
Then, i read that doing high intensity cardio the day before a leg lifting day is not good, because i&#39;m not resting enough after the hiit. So, to get it out of the way, should you do cardio on leg day? It is perfectly fine to combine cardio and lifting as long you have a good strategy. I just came home from this light cardio session, 5km in 27minutes.

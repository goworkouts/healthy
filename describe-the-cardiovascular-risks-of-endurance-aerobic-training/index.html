Endurance training can increase your maximal oxygen uptake, or vo2 max, which means your body learns to move and use oxygen with more efficiency during exercise. It is derived from the greek word “kardia”. 2013).several risk factors contribute to the development of cvds, such as age, elevated levels of blood cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, sedentary life style, and hypertension (hyp; To achieve cardiovascular endurance, you should exercise aerobically 30 minutes per day, 3 to 7 days per week.

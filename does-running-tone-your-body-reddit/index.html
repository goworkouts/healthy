Running Body Transformation, Six… From davitchell.blogspot.com
Running can help you lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Lost 30 pounds, improved my posture immensely, and generally felt better about myself as a person. Running is a forward motion that works the muscles in the front and back of your legs, but not the muscles that help you move from side to side. Not only does your diet determine how you burn fat, but to use running to its full potential, you need to be fuelling yourself in the right way too.

<p>Everybody wants a body like that, but can running tone your body? I ran track for a long time and with the workouts we did at track, it kept my bodyfat pretty low, i ate a lot and did 3 sets of 10 reps squats, deadlifts, curls. I do not like squats. Running will make you fast and enduring, but also pretty skinny (if you're doing more speed work than distance running, you'll get bigger legs).

<p>Running with the proper form along with adopting a clean diet builds muscles, toning your body, including your arms, legs, and waistline. Because running works the lower body more than the upper body, it also works well on toning your calves and shins. Run long enough and frequently enough and you'll lose weight, assuming, of course, you're following a nutritious diet. Running and walking both are different in working, but give the same kind of result, running is a slightly more advanced form and it uses maximum body strength than walking.

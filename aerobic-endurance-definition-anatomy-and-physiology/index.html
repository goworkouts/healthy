Aerobic exercise training leads to cardiovascular changes that markedly increase aerobic power and lead to improved endurance performance. Aerobic and anaerobic exercise depending upon whether the body uses oxygen or not in order to perform physical activities determines if the activity is aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (without. Endurance is the capacity of a person to work in unpleasant and hard situation without giving up. It increases your stamina and improves cardiovascular conditioning.

<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness has been defined by the sports medicine manual as one of the most important things that make up physiological fitness, which is closely related to the supply of oxygen to the respiratory and circulatory systems of the body when a person performs prolonged and continuous physical exertion. The capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to provide oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy synthesis during physical activity is referred to as cardiorespiratory fitness (crf). Regular exercise makes these systems more efficient by enlarging the heart muscle, enabling more blood to be pumped with each stroke, and increasing the number of small arteries in trained skeletal muscles, which. To be more specific, cardio endurance is a measurement of the performance of your cardiorespiratory system during sustained physical activity.

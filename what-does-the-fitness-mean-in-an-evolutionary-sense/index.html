(3 days ago) the best definition of evolutionary fitness is. What does evolutionary fitness measure? Fitness, in the sense of evolution does not necessarily mean the strongest, or fastest, or any other superlative. For biologists, fitness means an organism&#39;s propensity to survive and reproduce in a particular environment.

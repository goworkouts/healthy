People of all ages need to be physically active for at least 30 minutes a day to maintain good health, but cardiorespiratory fitness is necessary for older adults. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to working muscles during sustained physical activity, typically expressed as mlo2 kg − 1 min − 1, is often used as a proxy or an objective measure of physical activity [40]. Both observational and interventional studies suggest an important role for physical activity and higher fitness in mitigating the metabolic syndrome. Fundamentally, your level of fitness is a measure of the potency of your system.

<p>Good crf is not only important for your overall health and quality of life, such as your energy levels, sleep, and mood, but it also reduces the risk of heart disease. Cardiorespiratory endurance provides an indication of a person's physical fitness and measures how well the heart, lungs, and muscles perform during physical activity. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is a measure of how well the body can transfer oxygen to your own muscles during prolonged exercise, and of how well your muscles can consume and utilize the oxygen, once it’s been delivered, to generate adenosine triphosphate energy through cellular respiration. To adequately prepare for starting a personal fitness program, it is important to first assess your current level of fitness. Cardiorespiratory Endurance Exercises.</p>

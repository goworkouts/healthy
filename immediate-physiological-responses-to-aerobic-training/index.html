The reason for many of the immediate physiological responses to training is the increased amount of carbon dioxide produced by the working muscles, stimulating an increase in heart rate, ventilation. Physiological responses to training pdhpe: Resting heart rates (rhr) of 30 beats/ minute or less is not uncommon in elite athletes. Training to improve aerobic fitness results in responses from the respiratory system that are very similar to the responses of the cardiovascular system for aerobic fitness.

<p>When an individual exercises, various physiological changes occur within their body to ensure that adequate amounts of oxygen and nutrients are being provided to the working muscles. The important responses to training are related to; The reason for many of the immediate physiological responses to training is the increased amount of carbon dioxide produced by the working muscles, stimulating an increase in heart rate, ventilation, stroke volume and cardiac output. The main goal of this study was to investigate the acute metabolic and cardiorespiratory response to long and short hiie compared to continuous exercise (ce) as well as its regulation and predictability. 5 Immediate Physiological Responses To Exercise ExerciseWalls.</p>

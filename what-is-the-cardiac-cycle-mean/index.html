The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. The cardiac cycle is repeated after every 0.8 seconds and thereby pumps about 5 litres of blood in a single heartbeat. The cardiac cycle consists of the events in the heart from the start of one heartbeat to the start of the next. The diastole phase and the systole phase.

<p>The cardiac cycle is defined as a sequence of coordinated events taking place in the heart during each beat.

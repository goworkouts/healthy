<p>Aerobic exercise should still be included though as there are important health benefits to lower intensity exercises. The main differences between aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise are: At lower intensities of exercise, muscles burn a higher percentage of fat than carbohydrate, but not necessarily more total fat, or more total calories, than at higher intensities. One limitation to this way of measuring exercise intensity is that it does not consider the fact that some people have a higher level of fitness than others.

<p>You get more bang for the buck when muscles burn fat compared. Instead of constantly trying to add weight or reps to your lifts, give yourself time to repeat enough moderate intensity. National physical activity guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of high intensity aerobic activity every week.
